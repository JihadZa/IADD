# IADD

IADD is an Integrated Dataset for Arabic Dialect iDentification Dataset. It contains 136,317 texts representing 5 regions (Maghrebi (MGH) , Levantine (LEV), Egypt (EGY) , Iraq (IRQ) and Gulf (GLF)) and 9 countries (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Iraq).

IADD is created from the combination of subsets of five corpora: DART, SHAMI, TSAC, PADIC and AOC. The Dialectal ARabic Tweets dataset (DART) [1] has about 25,000 tweets that are annotated via crowdsourcing while the SHAMI dataset [2] consists of 117,805 sentences and covers levantine dialects spoken in Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. TSAC [3] is a Tunisian dialect corpus of 17,000 comments collected mainly from Tunisian Facebook pages. Parallel Arabic Dialect Corpus (PADIC) [4] is made of sentences transcribed from recordings or translated from MSA. Finally, the Arabic Online Commentary (AOC) dataset [5] is based on reader commentary from the online versions of three Arabic newspapers, and it consists of 1.4M comments.

IADD is stored in a JSON-like format with the following keys:
- Sentence: contains the sentence/ text;
- Region: stores the corresponding dialectal region (MGH, LEV, EGY, IRQ, GLF or general);
- Country: specifies the corresponding country, if available (MAR, TUN, DZ, EGY, IRQ, SYR, JOR, PSE, LBN);
- DataSource: indicates the source of the data (PADIC, DART, AOC, SHAMI or TSAC).
